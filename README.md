# making-a-list
a code where you can make a list using Python. Like if you were going to the store. Or, doing something, idk. This is just a script i made for fun.




mylist = []
mylist.append('LOADING...')
mylist.append('getting ready')
mylist.append('succesfully loaded!')
mylist.append('do you like it?')
mylist.append('you can change the text here, just dont remote the ')
print(mylist)
